# Assignment 3: EVIC App

**Deadline: March 13, 2016, 11:59pm, US Central**

## Tasks

In this third assignment (A3), you are to model and refine your EVIC GUI app 
from the second assignment (A2) so that it adopts the Model-View-Controller
(MVC) software architecture while maintaining the EVIC app from the
first assignment (A1) EVIC Console. 

Your specific tasks for this assignment are as follows:

*  Create a Visual Studio (VS) Model project and create a class diagram for your
   EVIC GUI app using the MVC architecture:
   
   a. Right-click on your EVIC VS Solution and select `Add`->`New Project...`;
      it will open the `Add New Project` dialog.
      
   b. On the left pane, select `Modeling Projects` under `Installed`, and then
      select `Modeling Project` on the updated center panel. Name your modeling
      project as `EVIC-Model` in the textbox labeled with `Name:` and then 
      click the `OK` button.
   
   c. Right-click on the newly created `EVIC-Model` project, and select
      `Add`->`New Item...`; it will open the `Add New Item` dialog.
      
   d. On the left panel, select `Modeling` under `Installed`, and then select
      `UML Class Diagram`. Name your class diagram `evic.classdiagram` and then
      click the `OK` button. 

   e. Design your MVC-style EVIC GUI app in the newly created class diagram.
      The class diagram should include classes from the "class library" project
      and the "Windows Form" project from A2. 
   
*  Modify your ** EVIC GUI app** from A2 to match your MVC design (make sure that
   the class diagram and the resulting implementation is consistent).


## Submission
